# Basic
Browser can't actually run PHP file. It renders whatever is returned from the PHP, inside a HTML document.

# Constant Variables
define() function is used to declare constants in PHP. After declaration of one constant, it can't be overridden anymore.
Exmp:
<?php
define('NAME', 'Yoshi');
echo NAME;
?>

# Variable Interpolation / Putting variables directly into the string
****** Inside the double quote it is possible to print the value of a variable by writing the variable name with dollar sign like this: echo"My name is $name" and it will print the value of the variable. But its not possible when single quote is used to echo the string.

# Escaping Characters inside Strings
Before the character we want to escape, we do a backshlash.

# Replacing certain things in a String
str_replace() function is used to replace certain characters inside a string. Exmp: str_replace('what you want to replace', 'what you want to replace with', variable name)

#Numbers
To use power(^) in PHP, PHP understands it as **

#Basic Functions
1. floor() -> This function takes an decimal / float number as input and return the lower integer value. Example: 3.14 will be return as 3
2. ceil() -> This function takes an decimal / float number as input and return the upper integer value. Example: 3.14 will be return as 4

#Arrays
To print full array with values, we use print_r which means print_readable. To print an array with all values, print_r($array);
To merge two arrays, array_merge function is used, and it has to be stored in another array.
array_pop() function take out the last element of an array. This function returns the element of that array so it's need tobe stored in a variable.

1. Indexed Arrays -> can be created normally like $array = ['one', 'two', 'three']; 
                                                  or
												  can be created by using array function like
												  $array = array('one', 'two', 'three');
												  
   To add a new value at the end of an Array, there are two ways to do that.
   First one is: 
   $array[] = 76; -> without using any index number.
   Another one is by using the function array_push()
   Exmp: array_push($nameOfTheArray,value);
   
   To count the element of an array count() function is used.
   
2. Associative Arrays -> Speciality(Key-Value Pairs)
   $arr = ['keyOne' => 'ValueOne', 'keyTwo' => 'ValueTwo', 'keyThree' => 'ValueThree'];
   echo $arr['keyTwo'];
   
   To add another value at the end of an associative array:
   $arr['keyFour'] = 'ValueFour';
   
   To override or to change an element's key in an associative array, just have to mention the key name and give the new value in the key name.
   
3. Multi - Dimensional Array
   $blogs = [
		['title' => 'TitleOne', 'author' => 'AuthorOne', 'content' => 'ContentOne', 'like' => 11],
		['title' => 'TitleTwo', 'author' => 'AuthorTwo', 'content' => 'ContentTwo', 'like' => 12],
		['title' => 'TitleThree', 'author' => 'AuthorThree', 'content' => 'ContentThree', 'like' => 13]
   ];
   echo $blogs[1]['content'];
   
   
#Loops
#Boolean
#Conditional Statements
$Functions
Function's parameter can be set as default. If no value is passed as parameter, then the default value will be printed.

**During printing a sentence with a variable's property like price, name etc, in PHP, the variable name and the property have to be in between the second bracket / curlibrases. Exmp: echo "{product['name']} costs ${product['price']}";

**If we want to use a global variable inside a function, we have to use the 'global' keyword in front of the variable name inside the function to use that global variable.

**If elements stored inside a global variable is changed inside the function where the variable is being used, then outside the function, the elements/value stored in that global variable also gets changed. (IMPORTANT) It only occurs when there is no argument passed, no parameter is received by function. Because, when a parameter is received, it becomes a local variable and indicates only the variable being used inside the function. And this can also be changed. This can be changed by using '&' sign before the parameters name in the line block where the function name is declared. It then counts that parameter as a reference variable which indicates that global variable. UFFFFF !!!!!!
